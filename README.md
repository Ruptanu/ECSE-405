Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna at 5.8 GHz for RFID Reader Applications with High Directivity and Gain
This paper compares the simulation results of a single patch antenna with a 2×1 array patch antenna in terms of gain, directivity, return loss, radiation pattern and adaptation. Thus the main goal of this project was to design a 2×1 array patch antenna of rectangular shape, with high radiation performances, to identify objects or living things in motion that are at further distances from RFID readers.
